Download the "Images_needed" zip file and the "odd_emotions_py_script.py" script on your laptop;
On your desktop, create a folder called "emotions_pract";
In this folder, place all the content of the zip file as well as the "odd_emotions_py_script.py" file;
Open your Terminal;
Change the working directory to the folder you created >> "cd Desktop/emotions_pract/";
After having changed the directory, type the following to run the script >> "sudo python3 odd_emotions_py_script.py" (or the corresponding command for your OS);
You might be prompted to input your laptop password;
Once that is done, the tkinter board should appear and you should be presented with emotional /neutral faces quite fast (each face lasts 50 ms) followed by a mask;
Once the mask is presented, you should press either "e" if the image you just saw was an emotional face, or "n" if it looked neutral.
This will repeat for ~ 35 stimuli of faces.
After all the face images are presented, the program should shut down automatically and it should redirect you to the terminal, where you should see the average reaction time for neutral and emotional faces.
hat's it!
PS: It might be that you have to install some modules "! pip install ..." (or the corresponding command for your OS) the first time you run the script, but the program should let you know if that's the case.
